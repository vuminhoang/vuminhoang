I'm Minh, a senior student at Hanoi University of Science, VNU, specializing in Data Science, and set to graduate in March 2025. I am proficient in Python programming, having achieved a 4-star rating in the Python skill assessment on HackerRank. My expertise lies in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

In ML, my work includes Data Analysis (DA) and developing predictive models, such as forecasting customer churn rates in the telecommunications sector. I've tackled diverse tasks for NLP, ranging from basic problems like text classification and summarization to complex projects leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) concepts, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and instruction fine-tuning LLMs using LoRA.

I have extensive experience with AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch and am proficient with Git for version control, enabling effective collaboration and project management.
